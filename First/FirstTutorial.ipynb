    "\n",
    "As we can see, all algorithms get better over time, showing our epsilon-greedy algorithm works, but the rate at which it improves, and the value at which it plateaus changes depending on our choice of epsilon value.\n",

    "Our y-axis matches the right y-axis in the graph from the paper (the net positive draws).\n",
    "\n",
    "The line plotted for the graph from the paper matches an epsilon value of 0.25 well. This suggests that humans make choices using a similar method to an epsilon-greedy algorithm with an epsilon value of 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "While an epsilon value matches humans, it is not the best result; all the other values give faster learning rates, and a higher plateau. This becomes especially important in similar problems with more choices (more decks of cards).\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the epsilon value to 0.1 means that the algorithm will choose to explore 10% of the time. This allows it to explore quite quickly, while exploiting this exploration the vast majority of time. This means this algorithm improves quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the epsilon value to 0.01 means the algorithm will only choose to explore 1% of the time. This means it improves quite slowly at the beginning, as the algorithm needs to run quite a few times before it obtains good exploration results. However, this value beats 0.1 in the long term, as once the algorithm has explored enough and has enough information about each of the decks, it will only draw from a deck that isn't the 'best' 1% of the time, while with an epsilon value of 0.1, a deck that isn't the 'best' will be drawn from 10% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this particular experiment, an epsilon value of 0.0, known as a 'greedy' algorithm actually performs best, as once it learns the 'best' deck, it will always pick it, and no choose any other deck. However, this would not be suitable for problems with decks that vary over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all means that in larger problems, a higher epsilon value at the beginning is the best, as it allows quick exploration, while a lower epsilon value the more the algorithm runs is the best, as this allows it to exploit more often once it has established the deck values. Some algorithms implement an epsilon value that starts higher, and slowly lowers over time, taking advantage of this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the epsilon values to see varying results, and as an exercise, try implementing an epsilon value that slowly decreases over time."
